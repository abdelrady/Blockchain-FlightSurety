Notes:

* I create a flight after any airline is funded in UI
* I added some apis in server app to call 2 contracts and check values stored. Here are soe apis

    List all flights registered in contract
    http://localhost:3000/airplanes/flights

    check flight info (status, isRegistered, etc...)
    http://localhost:3000/flight/0xC5fdf4076b8F3A5357c5E395ab970B5B54098Fef/FL-A-1556345060/0x5cc3f0e4

    check balance of a passenger (address will change per passenger)
    http://localhost:3000/passenger/0x2191eF87E392377ec08E7c08Eb105Ef5448eCED5/balance
